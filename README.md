# video_sync

Watch a video with someone miles away in real time!


How to use:
1. Send the url of the app to someone (or open multiple browsers and enter the url!).
2. Both parties must play the video at least once (do not use the play button)
3. Once each video is playing, use the sync button to sync each video together.
4. To cue another video, go to the YouTube video you want to watch with your friends and get the video ID:
  example:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxyMf9deVLg
    
    Video ID: QxyMf9deVLg <---- paste this into the loading form!
5. Play the video and bask in modern technology!!
